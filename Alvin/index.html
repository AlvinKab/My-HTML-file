            <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass">Grass</a> is a member of the class Monocotyledonae in the kingdom Plantae. It is one of the most diverse plants on the planet as there are multiple varieties of it. Grass can be as short as less than five centimetres(e.g. lawn grass) to as tall as three metres(e.g. elephant grass).It can be as fine and moist as a moss or as coarse as sandpaper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Believe it or not, grass is one of the most useful plants out there. For instance, some varieties of grass are usually fed to cattle as fodder, such as Napier grass. Dried grass can also be used as mulch. Tall grass such as elephant grass and buffalo grass can be used as camouflage by prey. Most grass nowadays is associated with recreation due to the ability of green grass to significatly improve the aura of the immediate environs. </p></li>

        <h3>Bathing vs Showering</h3>
        <p>Bathing and showering are two methods of cleaning one's body.
            <br> Each of these have their pros and cons.
        </p>
        <section>
        <h4>Bathing</h4>
        <img src="img/bathtub.img" alt="Bathtub">
        <p>Bathing often involves a limited supply of water.</p>
            <ol>
            <li> This water is usually in basins, buckets, or bathtubs.</li>
            <li> The advantage of this is that it is more economical, since it saves on water used, rducing water wastage.</li> 
            <li> However, it is also unhygenic since water is reused, thus is less effective.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Showering</h4>
        <img src="img/shower.img" alt="Shower">
        <p>Showering, on the other hand, involves an unlimited suppply of water coming out of a pipe with a wide and perforated end.
            <br>This method is preferred by many people since water is not reused, thus is not only effeicient, bu also refreshing.
            <br>Due to water not being reused, however, it ends up using more water, thus less economical.
        </p>
       
        <p>In conclusion, showering is better in my opinion.</p>
